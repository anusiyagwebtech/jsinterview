//What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?

In synchronous programming the program execution occur sequentially. And each statement blocks the execution until it is completed. In asynchronous 
programming , multiple tasks can be executed  concurrently and the program doesn't wait for the tasks to finish before moving to the next one.

 console.log('statement1');
    const HI = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      fetch('https://664b021aa300e8795d43d422.mockapi.io/hi/details').then((value) => {
        resolve(value.json());
      }).catch((reason) => {
        reject(reason);
      })
    });

    HI.then((value) => {
      console.log(value

);
    }).catch((reason) => {
      console.log(`reason: ${reason}`);
    })

   console.log('statement3');


// output:

statement1
statement3
array
