let and var keywords both are used to declare variables. but let keyword declares a local variable. it have block scope. it can access only the block of the code.
whereas var keyword  declares global variables. and it can access anywhere in the code.


//correct

let and const keywords are ES6 Feature. And they have block scope. Let is reassignable. const is non-reassignable. whereas var have function scope
and is redeclarable and also reassignable.
