Higher order functions are functions that can accept other function as an argument or return other function as their results. They enable powerful 
functional programming patterns in js.

  const nameprinter = (sentence) => {
   const reverse = sentence.split('').reverse().join('');

   return reverse;
  }


  const main = (name, nameprinter) => {
    const n = `I love ${name}`;

    return nameprinter(n);

  }

  console.log(main('dogs', nameprinter));
